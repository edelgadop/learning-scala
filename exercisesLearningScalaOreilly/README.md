This directory contains my proposed solutions to the exercises that can be found
in the end of each chapter from "Learning Scala. Practical Functional Programming from the JVM"
(Jason Swartz, Ed. O'Reilly).

The purpose of this repository is to track my own advance with the Scala language, and therefore
the implementations found on this directory may not be optimal.

Please feel free to contact me if you find wrong implementations, come up with corrections 
or simply want to remark something that could be done in another manner.
